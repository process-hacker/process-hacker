# Process Hacker for Windows 17.5 Build

Process Hacker offers options beyond those provided by the Windows Task Manager, allowing users to view and control processes and Windows services running on the system.

As a more feature-rich alternative to the standard Windows Process Manager, it provides extensive details and capabilities. Users can view processes in a tree structure, modify runtime parameters by right-clicking on processes, and access comprehensive details about them via the Properties option.

While Process Hacker isn't necessarily a direct replacement for Process Manager, it includes additional advanced tools that are better suited for experienced users rather than beginners.
